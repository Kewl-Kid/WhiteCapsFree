  <!-- Nathan's Story -->
  <h2 class="story-title fade-in">Nathan’s Story</h2>
  <br>
  <p class="aboutparagraph fade-in">
    Hi. It’s Nathan, from White Caps.<br><br>
    One morning in sophomore year, I was getting ready for school and caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. Something felt off. I didn’t like how I looked—not because of who I was, but because of what I was wearing. Most of my clothes didn’t feel like they reflected my identity. I grew up being told that buying clothes was impractical and that style was a luxury, not a necessity.

But as I grew older, I realized that clothing is more than just fabric. It’s how we express ourselves, how we feel confident, and how we connect with who we are. I started exploring different styles—trying out colorful basics and other brands that spoke more to me. It wasn’t just about the clothes anymore. It was about reclaiming something I never knew I needed: self-expression.

The deeper I got into fashion, the more I learned about the industry’s dark side. The waste. The pollution. The harm. I didn’t want to be another person contributing to that. That’s when I knew I wanted to build something different. With my partner Rehan and the support of my friends and family, White Caps was born: a brand built on purpose and responsibility.

  <h2 class="story-title fade-in">The Beach: Rehan's Story</h2>
  <br>
  <p class="aboutparagraph fade-in">
    Hey, it's Rehan.<br><br>
    There was one afternoon in India I’ll never forget. My cousins and I were visiting a beach my family loved. As a kid, I used to run across the sand in awe—chasing crabs, watching the waves, and feeling like I had the whole ocean to explore. It was alive. Vibrant. Magical.<br><br>
    But that day, it felt different. The sand was black and soft, nothing like the pale beaches back home. There was barely any life left. The shore was littered with plastic, fishing nets, and worse—dead fish, scattered across the sand. Some were small, others massive. Their eyes were clouded over, their scales dull. I kept trying to believe this was a rare case, a bad day. But I knew it wasn’t.<br><br>
    The ocean—the thing I thought was too big to be broken—was dying. And it was because of us.<br><br>
    Coming back to Allen, that beach stayed in my mind. Every time I saw someone litter, I thought of that lifeless water. We all hear about pollution, oil spills, and microplastics, but seeing it up close changed everything for me. I couldn’t ignore it anymore.<br><br>
    That trip made me realize I couldn’t sit back and do nothing. I might be just one person, but I want to be someone who tries. Nathan and I may not have all the answers, but we're determined to make a difference. We’re not here to preach—we’re here to act.
  </p>
